# IT3103 Exercise 4: Securing Microservices Architecture
## Microservice Overview
1. Product Service 
- POST /products: Add a new product.
- GET /products/:productId: Get customer details by ID
- PUT /products/:productId: Update a product
- DELETE /products/:productId: delete a product
2. Customer Service
- POST /customers: Add a new customer.
- GET /customers/:customerId: Get customer details by ID.
- PUT /customers/:customerId: Update customer information.
- DELETE /customers/:customerId: Delete a customer.
3. Order Service
- POST /orders: Create a new order. This service will:
Verify that the customer exists by communicating with the Customer Service.
Verify that the product exists by communicating with the Product Service.
Create the order only if the customer and product are valid.
- GET /orders/:orderId: Get order details.
- PUT /orders/:orderId: Update an order.
- DELETE /orders/:orderId: Delete an order.
## Installation and Running
1. Clone the project repository
```
git clone https://github.com/HPeroxide-Pe/midterm_securing-_microservices.git
```
2. Go inside the root directory
```
cd midterm_securing-_microservices
```
3. Generate SSL/TLS Certificates (for local development) : Use Git Bash
```
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.cert -days 365
```
Country Name (2 letter code): any 2 letters will do
just press ENTER until the end

This command will generate two files:
- localhost.key (your private key)
- localhost.cert (your certificate)
4. Use Node Package Manager to install project dependencies
```
npm install
```
5. Run each file individually in different terminal windows
```
node src/customer_service.js
```

```
node src/product_service.js
```

```
node src/order_service.js
```
6. Open Postman and create a new request.
7. Disable SSL Certificate Verification (since youâ€™re using a self-signed certificate):
- Click the gear icon in the upper right of Postman.
- Go to the General tab and toggle SSL certificate verification to OFF.
### Testing
Using any REST API client, send any HTTPS Request using any of the methods stated above, here are some test JSON inputs for the body:
1. Product
```JSON
{
	"name": "Nautilus Prime Set",
	"price": 80,
	"stock": 69
}
```
2. Customer
```JSON
{
	"name": "John Sevagoth Prime",
	"email": "johnsevagothprime@voidstorms.com",
	"address": "Veil Proxima St."
}
```
3. Order
```JSON
{
  "customerId": 0,
  "productId": 0,
  "quantity": 1
}
```
